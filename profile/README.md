# *“**Talent knows no boundaries”***

In a world where companies all over the world are going increasingly remote, Bangladesh **🇧🇩** is missing out on what could be one of the greatest arbitrages in the history of hiring.

### **Airwrk is building the future of work. 🚀**

The team at Airwrk is building the bridge that connects talented Bangladeshis to the global talent pool. We want to achieve what RMG has done for the country but in the context of the 4th Industrial Revolution i.e. with knowledge workers. As one of the most densely-populated countries in the world, we truly believe that our real assets are our people.
